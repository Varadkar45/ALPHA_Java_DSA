/*Question 3 :Add 1 to an integer using Bit Manipulation.(Hint: try using Bitwise NOT Operator) */
/*The expression -~x will add 1 to an integer x.We know that to get negative of a number, invert its bits and add 1 to it (Remember negative numbers are stored in 2’s complement form), i.e.,
-x = ~x + 1;
-~x = x + 1 (by replacing x by ~x)
